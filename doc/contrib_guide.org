* Coding Convention
** Code Tree Structure
*** Prefer short directory name as long as no ambiguity in the meaning. Truncate or abbreviate long name if needed.
*** Prefer lower-case directory name except it's a build interface.
*** Library directory should be decomposed into _include_ and _src_
**** Put headers under a subdirectory of _include_, with the library name as its name.
     For example, the package #TestLib# will have following tree structure:
     todo: add the snippet
**** Put sources under _src_
*** Plugin/Component sources and headers should locate in the same directory

** Naming
