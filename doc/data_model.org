* Data Model (a.k.a EDM4hep)
  The design of EDM4hep is well described in the official documentation of [[https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio][podio]].
  Here is some summary information and practical guide of how to use it in the context of *k4megat*.

* Further development
Two limitations exist in current k4FWCore implementation of EventStore:
1. Multi-Thread : is needed when all algorithm (including simulation) are MTed. Before that, we can leave
   it alone and focus on algorithm development.
2. not Frame-based : is madatory for triggerless acquisition but also suitable for conventional trigger
   based event stream. More importantly, Frame-based IO will be the official IO mechanism in the future
   development of PODIO. So, better keep an eye on its development.

Some reference implementations exist:
** EICEventStore in EICrecon (MT, not Frame-based)
- subclass of ICollectionProvider interface defined in PODIO
